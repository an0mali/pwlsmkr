A targeted password list generator for bruteforce attacks.

Theoretically a password of only 4 characters has around 45 million possible combinations.
Theoretically we can reduce a similar password to only 108 human-rememberable possibile cominations.
Thats a reduction of 416,666! Much wow. Now lets do that for three "terms" in the password...
416,666^3 == 7.23376157412963*10^16

It's no big deal really, don't worry about it.
It's not like human-rememberable passwords could possibly take 10 quadrillion years less time to crack....
Or could they?

...lets not even think about quantum computing.
This is just a theory. A PASSWORD THEORY.
Thanks for watching.
